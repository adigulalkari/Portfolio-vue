                        "description": "<br><h2>PRISM GenAI Intern - Samsung R&D Institute</h2><br>During my internship at Samsung R&D Institute India as a PRISM GenAI Intern, I specialized in creating and fine-tuning advanced AI models. This included web crawling e-commerce platforms using tools like Selenium and BeautifulSoup to build custom datasets, followed by prompt engineering to prepare training data. I fine-tuned the Llama3 Large Language Model (LLM) to answer domain-specific queries, leveraging techniques like instruction tuning and unslothing for performance optimization. This experience deepened my expertise in AI technologies and practical applications in e-commerce.  <br> <br><h2>Intern Data Scientist - Abbott</h2><br>As a Data Scientist Intern at Abbott, I conducted Payer Mix Analysis using SQL and advanced text processing on unstructured U.S. healthcare data. I worked on probabilistic record matching using the Splink package and clustering algorithms for linking Abbott’s databases. Additionally, I performed web scraping of healthcare websites and processed large datasets on Azure Databricks to uncover actionable insights. This role honed my skills in NLP, probabilistic modeling, and fuzzy matching while providing a solid understanding of the healthcare domain's business complexities."
